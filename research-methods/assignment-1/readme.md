2. A systematic literature review on online assessment security: Current challenges and integrity strategies

Abstract
Assessment is an integral part of online education, much like traditional classroom education. During the online assessment, evaluation of the learning outcomes presents challenges mainly due to academic dishonesty among students that may lead to unfair evaluations. This systematic review examines the research on online assessment security involving studies completed between 2016 and 2021. The review investigates the literature, around four critical themes - reasons for student engagement in dishonest behavior, mechanisms used for dishonesty, integrity strategies to handle dishonesty and the role of machine learning in integrity strategies. The results indicate that readily available opportunities provided by environmental factors like Internet availability, shadow individual characteristics of the student; the students with high moral values also often succumb to dishonesty. We found that among the five types of dishonest behaviors identified in online students, researchers have shown more interest in studying collusion and plagiarism. It is interesting to note that technology, a pre-requisite for the conduct of online assessments, is exploited by the students for dishonest behaviors vis-a-vis technology also plays a key role in mitigation. The integrity strategies fall under two approaches- prevention and detection. We propose an Academic Dishonesty Mitigation Plan (ADMP) that encompasses strategies from both prevention and detection approaches for effective security and integrity of online assessments. ADMP also necessitates the involvement of major stakeholders - platform owners, institutions, teachers and students, to establish a secure online assessment system. We find an increasing use of machine learning techniques to automate the detection of dishonest behavior. The findings provide a holistic understanding of academic dishonesty that could help preserve integrity in current online assessments.

Introduction
The education system has widely advanced from offline to online settings in the last two decades. The recent advancement in the field of information technology has resulted in the proliferation of online education all over the world (Martin et al., 2020). Moreover, in the current academic scenario arising out of the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an eventual shift to online education, globally (Balderas and Caballero-Hernández, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020). Many reputed institutions are now offering campus-like online courses as part of blended education or fully online education and as credit-based or non-credit-based courses (Butler-Henderson and Crawford, 2020; Wei et al., 2021). The ease of access, time flexibility and scalability are the key reasons for the rapid expansion of online education (Aljaraideh, 2019).

Much like traditional classroom education, assessments are an integral component of online education (Ullah et al., 2019a). Different types of assessments are used in online education to evaluate the learning outcomes and to test students' knowledge retention, application and extension (Butler-Henderson and Crawford, 2020; Chauhan and Goel, 2017a). Online assessments offer several benefits over traditional classroom exams, like the ease of evaluation, reduced cost and time and instant feedback. However, the benefits come along with certain challenges including the risk of academic dishonesty (Costley, 2019; McCabe et al., 2001). The terms academic dishonesty and cheating appear to be used interchangeably throughout the literature. According to King et al. (2009), cheating can be defined as a transgression against academic integrity which involves unfair methods that result in a misrepresentation of a student's ability and knowledge. In another study (Blau and Eshet-Alkalai, 2017), academic dishonesty is described as a non-legitimate behavior that occurs during the completion of learning activities, such as taking exams and writing papers or homework. Etgar et al. (2019) discusses digital academic dishonesty that refers to academic offenses where digital technologies are employed. Alexandron et al. (2019) define cheaters as the users who use methods that break the code of honor to achieve credit in a way that does not rely on learning.

Academic dishonesty is one of the biggest challenges in maintaining the security and integrity of online assessments. In a survey conducted by Costley (2019), approximately 60 percent of the students admitted to cheating in online assessments. It results in the unfair evaluation of students, as under normal online settings, it is very difficult to assess if the student's work is original (Gamage et al., 2020). The incorrectly graded learning outcomes raise questions over the value of online course certificates (Alexandron et al., 2017) and institutional credibility (Amigud et al., 2018), causing employers to lose faith in the competencies of online graduates. Furthermore, it causes students to develop a bad habit of not learning, thereby wasting the large amounts of time and resources that have been devoted for the attainment of quality education purposes (Arnold, 2016; Xiong and Suen, 2018). It is also important to solve the issue of dishonesty as it affects other research studies by providing false conclusions (Alexandron et al., 2019b). The postponement and cancelation of exams following the outbreak of the COVID-19 reveal the extent of the problem (Ngqondi et al., 2021). However, as the pandemic continued, the need for secure online assessments that ensure integrity has become more urgent.

The first and primary dimension of addressing academic dishonesty is understanding why students cheat. This involves analyzing student attitudes and perceptions that motivate them towards violating assessment integrity. Several researchers (Adzima, 2020; Butler-Henderson and Crawford, 2020; Husain et al., 2017) have performed systematic reviews of student and teacher perceptions of online cheating behaviors. Identification of accurate reasons is critical, as it identifies the root cause for the problem and subsequently, helps to formulate an appropriate solution. In addition, contextual factors also play a role as many reports (Dendir and Maxwell, 2020; Peled et al., 2019) indicate that students find it easier to cheat online and most of them engage in some kind of dishonest behaviors during their assessments.

The second critical dimension of academic dishonesty is identifying how students cheat. There are many systematic reviews (Amigud et al., 2018; Ngqondi et al., 2021; Stoesz and Yudintseva, 2018) that discuss the challenges concerning online assessment security. Previous research has shown that online assessments are vulnerable to various kinds of cheating behaviors such as misrepresentation of identity (Mungai and Huang, 2017), use of unauthorised resources (Hylton et al., 2016), collusion (Crook and Nixon, 2019) and plagiarism (Awasthi, 2019; Husain et al., 2017; Karnalim et al., 2019; Marques et al., 2019). With the rise in technology, new cheating methods are frequently improvised by learners which makes it is essential to identify these methods to locate the loopholes in the assessment security process.

The third and the most important dimension is the identification of practices that can be employed in safeguarding academic integrity. These practices are concerned with establishing a secure and integrated environment for the conduct of online assessments. Implementation of these practices could help mitigate academic dishonesty in online assessments by strengthening the existing assessment system. There exist some recent systematic reviews (Butler-Henderson and Crawford, 2020; Gamage et al., 2020; Lee-Post and Hapke, 2017) that discuss assessment security in the digital domain and evaluate the mitigation strategies from different universities.

The existing reviews reveal that academic dishonesty is indeed a widespread problem in online education. So far, the published reviews primarily focus on a few types of dishonest practices. However, we could not find a consolidated literature review that addresses different types of dishonest practices that are observed in the online assessments. Moreover, we observe that machine learning is being used for the detection of cheating by many approaches, but none of the existing review papers provide an in-depth analysis into its role for the same. With the increase in online learning platforms like Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), the average class size has increased manifolds with up to thousands of learners taking the exam at the same time. With such a massive number of learners, using machine learning techniques as a data analysis tool can be helpful to extract useful patterns in data. Hence, the fourth and final dimension of our study is how machine learning can be employed for addressing academic dishonesty.

The objective of this study is to perform a comprehensive and systematic review of the recently published literature that investigates the integrity and security of online assessments. We also propose an Academic Dishonesty Mitigation Plan that provides a comprehensive approach for preserving integrity in online assessments.
