- **Quality Check**: When an article is submitted for publication, it undergoes a quality check called ‘Peer Review’.

### Peer Review Goals
- **Originality**: Ensures the **research is original** and contributes something new to the existing body of work.
- **Soundness**: Ensures the **research has followed correct academic conventions**, and conclusions are backed by evidence.
- **In-House Guidelines**: Checks adherence to specific journal guidelines like **citation style**, **use of graphs**, **article length**, and **appropriate structure** (introduction, discussion, conclusion).
- **Theme Appropriateness**: Ensures the theme of the article aligns with the themes the journal aims to publish.

### Publication Process
- Articles rarely accepted without **requests for revisions**.
- Once revisions are made, the article will be published in the journal.

### Additional Resource
- **Video**: 'Peer Review in 3 Minutes' on YouTube explains the process and role of peer review in scholarly research and publication. [View on YouTube](http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/tutorials/peerreview/)
