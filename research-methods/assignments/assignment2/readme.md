## Effective Configuration of Research

> You work for a large IT consultancy that works in many different sectors, and provides many services in house (such as customer support, business planning, asset management etc). You have recently been on a **project to help a large green energy company select an off-the-shelf client relationship management system** (CRM). By going through this process you have realised that your own companies system can be significantly improved, however its an **old system that has gone through many iterations**, so it is not clear where or how changes should be made to improve both the efficiency and useability of the current system. **Your manager is supportive of a project to re-develop the internal CRM**, however before committing significant resources, they (as the client) require more specific information on where to target the effort, and which part of the business to concentrate on first.

### Define what you consider the three main research questions that need to be answered in the course of your conducting this consultancy project
1. Where are the current bottlenecks and challenges within the existing CRM system?
2. What specific features are necessary in the new CRM system to improve different departments' unique needs?
3. How can the transition to a new CRM system be managed smoothly?
4. What are the costing savings if there migration to the re-developed intern CRM were to be performed

### Describe how qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to answer these questions and draw out the best findings for your client outlining existing data and that which requires collection. (limit 300 words)

#### Qualitative Methods:

* First Question
We need to understand the departments view on what challenges are currently there with the existing internal CRM. To achieve this a survey can be performed and interviews can be conducted a selected few numbers of people. On site visits and see how different departments utilise the internal CRM would also be useful. Unstructured interviews with stakeholders from different department would allow a broader depth to be revealed.

To assess the qualitative aspect of the questions, such as identifying the number of challenges, we can create a survey in the form of an online questionnaire. This survey can be conveniently distributed via email to all potential users from different departments. As an incentive, participants could be offered the chance to win gift cards through a draw. Challenges and things can be tallied so quantitative analysis of the current CRM data will facilitate the identification of patterns and trends in inefficiencies.

* Second question
A detailed requirement gathering can be conducted through workshops and surveys to gather qualitative understanding and needs for stakeholders from various departments. Quantitative methods such as online surveys, an be used to identify usage patterns from the current CRM system and potential impacts if the new CRM system were to be introduced.

* Third question
A detail analysis of the existing system and code would be required to understand the dependencies required for redeveloping the CRM system. Relevant stakeholders and engineerings also to be asked via meeting or interviews to devise a contingency plans and rollback plans in case the rollout is unsuccessful to production.

A roadmap and quantitative predictive analysis will be created to detail a potential timeline and resource allocations when part of the systems are changed to use the new CRM.

During the transition phase, qualitative feedback through canary releases, pilot testing to fine-tune the transition strategies can be employed to ensure that there are no problems.

### Describe the resources you expect to be necessary, considering time, money and expertise, breaking this down into key activities that will be required. (limit 300 words)

#### Activity 1: Information and Data Gathering
Relevant stakes and subject matter experts from the part of the existing system should be pulled together and hold a meeting or form a panel of interview to understand the amount of effort that is needed to redeveloped the CRM. 


#### Activity 2: Solution Architecture Creation
A possible architecture of the system the involves the redeveloped CRM should be created to inform decisions on amount of resources to be allocation to each part of the implement and also shed light on the the cost. This can be created by analysing the existing code of the system and examining documentations detailing the existing architecture. Also meetings and interviews with subject matter experts when unresolved questions arises.

Note: This stage could also happen after recruitment in order to involve new recruits in the loop.

#### Activity 3: Recruitment
Roles and responsibilities need to be defined in the recruitment phase by identifying certain skills that is required to redevelop the new CRM system. The HR team should be notified of these skills and screening and interview process to assess suitable candidates should commence. Onboarding and training process of new recruits should be also be carefully planned and considered.

#### Activity 4: Roadmap
Following the research, a detailed plan outlining the development roadmap be drafted. A team with project managers, business analysts, and IT specialists will be assembled. This phase demands a substantial financial commitment to ensure the recruitment of skilled personnel and the acquisition of necessary technology infrastructure.

#### Activity 5: Implementation
Finally, in the implementation phase, structured training programs to facilitate smooth transitions, entailing time and financial resources to develop training materials and conduct workshops. Also daily standups within teams should be held and weekly technical showcases should be held where each team nominates a person to detail what are the new changes they have created in their development teams.

#### Activity 6: Follow Up and Report
After the CRM is redeveloped and deploy into production. Follow ups need to be made to ensure that there is no bugs or issues with the system. During the initial weeks following deployment, continuous monitoring should be in place to identify any system bugs or inefficiencies immediately. This involves setting up automated tracking tools that can promptly detect and report issues.

It is essential to solicit feedback from the end-users who interact with the system daily. This could be facilitated through online surveys or feedback forms integrated within the CRM system, allowing users to report any issues or suggest improvements.

| Question #                                                                      | Issue Identified                                 | Suggestion of how to improve |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| "Since every IT student knows Python, how would you rate your expertise in it?" | Leading Question, Loaded Question, Prestige bias |                              |
|                                                                                 |                                                  |                              |
|                                                                                 |                                                  |                              |
|                                                                                 |                                                  |                              |


#### Problem 1: Leading Question, Loaded Question, Prestige bias
Example Question:
"Since every IT student knows Python, how would you rate your expertise in it?"

The phrase "every IT students knows python" suggests that the person asked should know it need and need to rate it.

Proposal for Improvement:
* Remove the unnecessary part of the question causing it to become a leading question.
"how would you rate your expertise in Python?"

#### Problem 2: Prestige Bias and Loaded Question
Example Question:
"Why do you think some students avoid specialising in the obviously lucrative field of data science?"

The adjective "lucrative" has a very positive connotation and is hinting to the person being asked it would be absurd if his opinion is different.

The word "avoid" also carries an assumption that students are avoiding data science which may not be correct.

Proposal for Improvement:
* Remove the adjective "lucrative".
* Remove the word "avoid" to avoid generalisations.

"What do you think are some reasons that students might choose not to specialise in data science?"

#### Problem 3: Poor Answer Scale Options, Technical Terms/Jargon, ambiguous
Example Question:
"On a scale from 1 to 5, how proficient are you in handling and mitigating stack buffer overflows in legacy systems?"

The person being asked this question may not be capable of knowing what stack buffer overflow is. Also it is not clear what a rating of 5 would mean? It is very subject in that some people may rate themselves as 5.

Proposal for Improvement:
* Simplify the question and provide a brief explanation of the technical terms, 
* Remove the scale completely and ask more in depth questions.
"Do you know C programming language?"
"What techniques are there in secure coding practices in the C programming language do you know?"
"Do know know any techniques handling and preventing errors in older computer systems (such as stack buffer overflows)?"

#### Problem 5: Poor Answer Scale Options, ambiguous
Example Question:
"Popular opinions suggest that blockchain and quantum computing are the future. How prepared and excited are you for these inevitable changes?"

Proposal for Improvement:
* Separate the question into two distinct questions, each addressing one aspect (preparedness and excitement).
* Remove the scale and incorporate only yes no or no answer so user can more easily give an answer.

"Do you feel for the potential changes brought about by developments in blockchain?"
* Yes 
* No
* Don't have an answer

"Do you feel for the potential changes brought about by developments in quantum computing?"
* Yes 
* No
* Don't have an answer


"Are you excited about the potential changes brought about by developments in blockchain?"
* Yes 
* No
* Don't have an answer

"Are you excited about the potential changes brought about by developments in quantum computing?"
* Yes 
* No
* Don't have an answer
