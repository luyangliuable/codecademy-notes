### Overview
- The search for literature is **not linear**; it starts broadly and **narrows as understanding develops**.
- Keywords become more specific and deliberate; **keeping a record of them is helpful**.

### Challenges
- It can be intimidating or frustrating, with **too many or too few results**.
- This is common and not unusual, especially for those new to information research.

### ISP Explained (Kulthau, 1991)
- An iterative process, involving many thoughts, feelings, and actions.
- Consists of seven stages:

  1. **Initiation**: Starting the search.
  2. **Selection**: Choosing specific areas or topics.
  3. **Exploration**: Exploring different sources and angles.
  4. **Formulation**: Defining the focus of the research.
  5. **Collection**: Gathering relevant information.
  6. **Presentation**: Organizing and presenting the findings.
  7. **Assessment**: Evaluating the research process and results.

### Note
- The ISP is not a 'how to guide'; it's meant to **normalize a process** that may be intimidating or frustrating for those new to research.
