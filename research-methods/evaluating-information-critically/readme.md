A framework for assessing the usefulness of literature for assessment tasks:

- **Currency**: Is the **information recent**? Has it been revised or updated?
- **Relevance**: Does the source have the **information you need**?
- **Authority**: Do the **authors have the required expertise**?
- **Accuracy**: Does the source **reference other reliable sources**?
- **Purpose**: What does the source aim to do? Inform? Persuade? Entertain?

### Importance
