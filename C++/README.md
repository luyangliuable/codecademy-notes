# C++

## Case sensitive

**Simple hello-world app:** <br />
```C++
// This program outputs the message "Hello World!" to the monitor
 
#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
 
   std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
 
   return 0;
 
}
```

C++ is a case-sensitive language. If you were to type Cout or COUT, the compiler would not know that your intention was to use the keyword cout.

## Comments

```C++
// This program outputs the message "Hello World!" to the monitor
```

## Pre-processor directive
```C++
#include <iostream>
```

## Code → Save → Compile → Execute

When you program in C++, you mainly go through 4 phases during development:

**Code** — writing the program <br />
**Save** — saving the program <br />
**Compile** — compiling via the terminal <br />
Execute — executing via the terminal <br />
And repeat (debug the errors if needed). <br />
