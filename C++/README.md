# C++

## Case sensitive

**Simple hello-world app:** <br />
```C++
// This program outputs the message "Hello World!" to the monitor
 
#include <iostream>
 
int main() {
 
   std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
 
   return 0;
 
}
```

C++ is a case-sensitive language. If you were to type Cout or COUT, the compiler would not know that your intention was to use the keyword cout.
