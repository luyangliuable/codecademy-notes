# Human values violations in app reviews

"Being honest and trustworthy colleague" and the "achievement of high quality" software is **placed lower to other factors** such as the "software being commercially successful" and the software 'influencing the end users.'

## Motivation

Some value-violating app defects can remain unfixed for a long time if there is driver to prioritise them.

These defects result in poor take-up of apps, confused or unhappy users, organisational reputational damage and lost customers. Hence our work aims to contribute an understanding of the violations of human values in mobile apps by detecting these violations in app reviews. We aim to help developers to better understand and identify these end user human values violations in their apps with a view to being able to both fix them and avoid them in future. Following this aim, we guided our study with the following questions:

RQ1 What are the most common human values violations perceived by app users as documented in their mobile app reviews?

RQ2 Which reviews indicating human values violations bymobile app are the most supported by other end users?

RQ3 Are app description features related to specific human values violations?
