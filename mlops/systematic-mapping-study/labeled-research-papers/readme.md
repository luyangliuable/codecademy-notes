## Towards MLOps: A Framework and Maturity Model
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582569

Based on the provided excerpt from the research paper, the focus seems to touch upon all the three categories of your proposed classification scheme. However, the paper focuses more on "MLops Frameworks, Notations and Tools" and "MLops Evaluation Methods". Below are the mappings:

MLops Frameworks, Notations and Tools:
The paper discusses various tools, frameworks, and practices associated with MLOps, such as CI/CD integration, automated deployment, model monitoring, data pipelines, data version control (DVC), model versioning, Artifactory for model storage, usage of Docker containers and Kubernetes for deployment and scaling, etc.

MLops Evaluation Methods:
The paper presents an evaluation of MLOps practices by presenting case studies from three companies. They investigate the existing infrastructure, tools used, and level of automation to judge the level of MLOps maturity in these companies. The paper proposes a maturity model and maps the companies to different stages of this model based on their automation capabilities and MLOps practices.

Application Domains and MLops Focus Areas:
While the paper does not explicitly discuss specific application domains, it does mention practices that could be applied in various domains, such as automated model deployment, model monitoring, and data versioning. The paper also emphasizes cross-functional teams in the MLOps context, implying a focus on organizational and procedural aspects of MLOps. Nonetheless, it doesn't delve deep into specific application domains or industries where MLOps is used, which makes this classification less prominent than the first two.


## Towards Automation for MLOps: An Exploratory Study of Bot Usage in Deep Learning Libraries
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842552
The provided research paper, based on its content and focus, appears to map mainly onto the "MLops Frameworks, Notations and Tools" category in your classification scheme. This is due to the fact that the paper discusses various automated tools (or 'bots') used in machine learning operations (MLOps) within the context of three popular deep learning libraries (Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow).

The paper primarily investigates:

The range of automated bots used in these libraries.
How these bots are utilized in different aspects of the software development process.
Issues and challenges that may arise from bot usage.
In the context of your classification scheme, the following are the answers:

MLops Frameworks, Notations and Tools: The paper explores various automated bots used in MLops, such as the code-coverage-bot, facebook-github-bot, build-bot, ci-bot, tensorflow-bot, google-ml-butler, zenhub-bot, pytorchbot, tensorflow-butler, tensorflow-capybara, cla-bot, mention-bot, and stale-bot. These bots help in various tasks including code coverage calculation, continuous integration, issue management, commit mapping, licensing checks, identifying potential reviewers, and tracking development inactivity. They are also employed in onboarding new contributors.

MLops Evaluation Methods: While the paper doesn't primarily focus on evaluation methods, it does indirectly touch upon this area by highlighting some issues and shortcomings related to the usage of bots. For instance, it mentions issues related to bugs in code coverage and CI-related bots, inadequacies in bot-related documentation, and the need for better design practices to improve human-bot interactions.

Application Domains and MLops Focus Areas: The application domain here is the usage of bots in MLops within three specific deep learning libraries. The focus area includes understanding the roles these bots play in automating development tasks, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, and deriving insights to guide future improvements.
