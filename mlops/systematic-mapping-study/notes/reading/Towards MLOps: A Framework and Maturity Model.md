## Authors: [Names of the Authors]

## Publication Year: [Year of Publication]

## Source/Conference/Journal: [Source of the Paper]
 
## Abstract/Introduction Summary:
[Brief summary of the paper's abstract or introduction, highlighting the main focus and purpose of the study.]
Main Focus and Purpose:

* Investigate the adoption and integration of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) in large-scale software development companies.
* Provide an understanding of the activities involved in the adoption of MLOps and the stages of maturity companies undergo as they adopt and integrate MLOps.
Key Highlights:
* DevOps, which focuses on seamless software and systems engineering practices, has revolutionized business operations, leading to shorter development and deployment cycles.
* Machine Learning (ML) has become an integral part of decision-making in companies, leading to cost savings and novel ways of conducting business.
* MLOps is a recent practice aiming to apply DevOps concepts to ML systems. It bridges the gap between data scientists and operations teams.
* There's a noted disparity: ML processes aren't always well integrated with continuous software development and deployment.
* The research is aimed at advancing the understanding of MLOps through:
* A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a Grey Literature Review (GLR).
* Deriving a framework based on these reviews that captures the essence of MLOps.
* Proposing a maturity model that defines the stages of MLOps adoption in companies.
* Validating the derived framework and maturity model using three case companies.

Research Contributions:

Conduct a SLR and GLR to present the current state-of-the-art on MLOps adoption.
Propose a maturity model that highlights the evolutionary stages of MLOps adoption in companies.
Validate the MLOps framework and maturity model using case studies of three companies.

RQ2: Approaches and Tools for MLOps:

## Approaches:
* When performance drops via REST endpoint/custom code, streaming engine, micro-batch
* CI/CD pipeline
* Continuous retrainign

## Challenges:
* High AI costs and expectations.
* Fewer data scientists: need for talents
* Need for large datasets
* privacy concerns
* noisy data, lack of domain experts *
* labeling issues
* increasing feature complexity 
* improper feature selection 
* introduction of bias when experimenting with models 
* highly complex DL models 
* need for deep DL knowledge 
* difficulty in determining final model 
* model execution environment 
* more hyperparameter settings 
* verification and validation
* less DL deployment
* integration issues
* internal deployment
* need for an understandable model
* training-serving skew
* enduser communication
* model drifts
* maintaining robustness

* tracking and comparing experiments
* lack of version control
* difficulty in deploying models
* insufficient purchasing budgets 
* a challenging regulatory environment.
