[Brief summary of the paper's abstract or introduction, highlighting the main focus and purpose of the study.]

RQ1: Motivation and Benefits of Using MLOps:
Main Focus: Exploration and comparison of MLOps tools that support the automation of Machine Learning pipelines using DevOps practices.

Purpose of Study:

Investigate tools that support the creation of MLOps pipelines.
Analyze the main characteristics and features of these tools to offer an understanding of their value.
Key Points:

Background:

DevOps: Organizations use DevOps to facilitate collaboration between software development and operations teams, enabling faster software deployment. Despite the many tools provided by Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying and operating cloud applications, it remains underutilized due to challenges in managing and configuring resources.
MLOps: Managing ML models presents unique challenges, necessitating new development processes across the ML lifecycle. MLOps has been introduced to address these issues, advocating for automation and monitoring throughout the ML pipeline. Despite the introduction of several tools, MLOps is still relatively nascent with limited resources available.
Approach: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, drawing from both academic (white) and non-academic (grey) literature, such as reports, blogs, white papers, and official documentation. The aim was to extract and analyze MLOps tools based on different characteristics.

Findings: The study reveals that while most MLOps tools offer similar features, they employ different approaches that have distinct advantages based on user needs. Some findings include the scalability of Cloud-based ML Platforms, customization capabilities of Orchestration Platforms, and portability features of TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

Contribution: The research fills a gap in the literature by offering a comprehensive comparison of MLOps tools and features. It aids in identifying the most suitable components for managing ML pipelines and leveraging MLOps benefits.

The paper's structure covers an overview of MLOps, related work, research design, results, threats to validity, and conclusions. An online appendix provides additional details from the multivocal literature review.

## Reviewer's Comments: [Any subjective notes, comments, or observations you might have after reading and summarizing the paper.]
* I didn't fully go through related works but they seem decent for snowballing and offer more insights on our research questions.
* This is a really good paper as it explores all MLops tools and their features.
* Paper also split tools and features into categories we could do that oo
* Ackowldeges threats to validity we could do this too
