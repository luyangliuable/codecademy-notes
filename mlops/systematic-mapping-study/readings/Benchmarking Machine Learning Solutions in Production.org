#+TITLE: Benchmarking Machine Learning Solutions in Production
#+DESCRIPTION: 

* TODO Paper 14 MLOps Challenges in Multi-Organization Setup
** Challenges
*** many ML professionals are not experts in system operations and may not have the skills to easily setup a monitoring and benchmarking environment
*** A lack of memory,
*** long training time, 
*** or low-latency serving requirements
*** support for parallel execution
*** cost can become exceedingly high
*** identify which parts of the ML pipeline are responsible for the observed data requires careful tuning and preparation
** TODO Benefit
** TODO Tool
*** Amazon SageMaker1
*** Google Cloud Platform 
*** Prometheus3 for monitoring dotnet
*** Docker and docker stats for monitoring
*** Matplotlib
*** Apache JMeter8
*** Ubenchmark
**** allow the developer to easily mark points-of-interest (POI) inside ML tasks
** TODO Approach 
*** Horizontal scalability
*** Fully-managed cloud-based platform
*** Value imputation
**** replacing missing data with default values
*** feature transformation (creating new features from existing ones)
** TODO Metrics
*** CPU usage
*** memory usage
*** GPU usage
*** task completion times
*** disk input/output (IO) operations
*** operations and network traffic
