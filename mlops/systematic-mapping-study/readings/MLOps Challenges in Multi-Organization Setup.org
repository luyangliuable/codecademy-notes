** Challenges
*** Ensuring data is reliable
*** data can be processed according to the needs at hand
*** Continuous deployment of ML features is complex
*** Ownership issues with datasets
*** APIs, data formats, performance issues and so on are similar to any other information system integration between two or more organizations
*** data sets cannot be moved across data boundaries, but multiple organizations need to
access the data.
*** data must be from the same temporal range, and otherwise the operations make no sense
** TODO Benefit
** TODO Tool
*** ThoughtWorks
*** model re-training
**** iterative re-training with 45000 patient records improved modelsâ€™ performance to a certain extent, showing the benefits of model re-trainin
*** datalakes
**** can be used to integrate data from various sources
***** shared between the different information systems, so that it is clear which citizen is being attributed at a given time, and for what purpose
** TODO Approach
*** CI/CD
*** Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML)
*** human-centric personal data ecosystem
*** digital twin paradigm
*** unique identity system
** organization-level operations
*** Culture collaboration between organisations

** TODO Metrics
