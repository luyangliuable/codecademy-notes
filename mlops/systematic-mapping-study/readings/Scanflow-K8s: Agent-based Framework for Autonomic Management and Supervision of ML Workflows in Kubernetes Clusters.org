#+TITLE: Towards Regulatory-Compliant MLOps: Oravizio’s Journey from a Machine Learning Experiment to a Deployed Certified Medical Product
#+DESCRIPTION:

* TODO MLOps Challenges in Multi-Organization Setup
** Challenges
Data Governance: Sharing and using data across multiple organizations raises privacy, security, and governance issues.
Model Compatibility: Different organizations may use various machine learning frameworks, leading to compatibility issues.
Resource Allocation: Ensuring fair use of resources like compute and storage across organizations.
Collaboration: Making sure that the different organizations are effectively collaborating, especially when optimizing for application-level metrics.
** TODO Benefit
Standardization: An agent-based approach could standardize the management of ML workflows across organizations.
Optimized Resource Utilization: Intelligent agents can make resource allocation decisions based on both infrastructure and application-level metrics, offering a better QoS.
Agility: The ability to quickly adapt to changes and failures can lead to more resilient workflows.
** TODO Tool
Scanflow-K8s: As demonstrated in the paper, this tool could serve as a useful platform for managing complex ML workflows in a multi-organization setup due to its autonomic capabilities.
** TODO Approach
Agent-Based Autonomic Management: Employ intelligent agents that understand both infrastructure-level and application-level metrics for resource management.
Multi-layered Strategy: Employ a layered approach to control various aspects of both the application and the infrastructure.
** TODO Metrics
QoS metrics: Average queries per second per replica, latency, etc.
Resource Utilization Metrics: CPU usage, memory usage, etc.
Throughput and Availability: Keeping track of the uptime of services and the number of processed queries.
** TODO Responsible AI mentions
Fairness: Ensuring that the AI models deployed do not discriminate against any group, especially in a multi-organizational setup where data may come from diverse sources.
Explainability: The model should be interpretable to stakeholders from all organizations involved.
** TODO How to implement Responsible AI
Transparency: Share all aspects of the model—data, architecture, and decision-making criteria—amongst all organizations involved.
Audits and Checks: Regularly perform audits to ensure that the AI models meet ethical guidelines.
Training: Make sure that everyone involved understands the principles of responsible AI and how to implement them.
