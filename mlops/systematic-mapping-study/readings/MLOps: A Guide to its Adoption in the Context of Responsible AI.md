## Abstract/Introduction Summary:
[Brief summary of the paper's abstract or introduction, highlighting the main focus and purpose of the study.]

RQ1: Motivation and Benefits of Using MLOps:

## Motivation:
* Leads to a better implementation of ML models and more long-term business value, also reducing risks in AI processes 

## Benefits:
[Key benefit 1 of using MLOps as mentioned in the paper]

RQ2: Approaches and Tools for MLOps:

## Approaches:
* Kubflow
* TensorFlow Extende
* MLFlow
* Databricks 
* Microsoft Azure 
* Google Cloud 
* AWS Sage-Maker 
* CI/CD pipeline
  * all pipelines running in an automated process, guaranteeing that everything is thoroughly tested and validated
* Continuous training (CT) 
  * Bringing automation to the model training process so that it can be continuously retrained and prepared for redeployment
* Continuous monitoring (CM)
  * A concept that comes from the DevOps umbrella and allows the identification of risks and maintenance of the model in production, aligned with the business metrics
* Generally, the fewer tools we use the better because it is easier, for example, to archive compatibility between 3 tools than between 5.

## Challenges:
* implementing and operating this model in production
* version control, model reproducibility and scalability, and alignment with stakeholders.
* changing culture for mlops: traditional companies or companies that are not used to agile development practices
* model degradation

Strategies/Methods:
* Be Open to Learning and Changing the Culture
  * open to learning and willing to change â€“ and that goes for the adoption of MLOps, DevOp
  * good communication and understanding of responsibilities
  
* Clear definition of the business objectives that one wants to achieve
  * RACI (acronym that stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) matrix
  * OKRs (objectives and key results

* Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each tool depending on the scenario.

* Versioning artifacts is recommended to ensure more traceability, maintenance, and prevent failures, making sure that the data is synchronized and up to date. 
  * version control makes it possible to revert and restore if model degraded
  * identifying bugs and failures, which leads to faster feedback and remediation.
  * contribute is the reproducibility of the model
