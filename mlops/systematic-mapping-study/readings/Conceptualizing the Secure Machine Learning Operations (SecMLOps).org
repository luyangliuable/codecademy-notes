** Challenges
*** Reliability
*** Security
**** Adversarial attacks, large control surface to exploit
**** Data poisoning attack
**** Model theft
**** selected metrics is sound
*** A lack of highly skilled experts for roles involved in MLOps
*** Inefficient communication
*** Managing voluminous and varying data
*** scalability of the infrastructure [15]
*** monitoring [19]

** TODO Benefit

** TODO Tool

** TODO Approach
*** SecMLOps
*** Xplainable Artificial Intelligence
*** PPTGC framework
*** Security Engineering
*** Business problem analysis
*** security models
**** attack/adversarial models
**** threat models
**** ML attack surfaces 
*** MITRE ATT&CK framework
*** Access Control
*** Encryption
*** logging functions
**** A well-known searchable knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques for traditional software security.
*** role-based access control (RBAC)
*** single sign-on authentication
*** virus scanning
*** network isolation
*** Continuous learning and awareness
*** People-centric security
*** Organisational standards and guidelines

** TODO Metrics

*** explainability

*** reliability

*** safety

*** sustainability

*** fairness

*** Interpretability

*** transparency

*** The percentage of people who completed security awareness training

*** the percentage of people who attended activities related to promoting security;

*** current level of maturity in the Capability Maturity Models (CMM)

*** the number of times security policies are violated

*** the number of times that significant performance drop is due to adversarial attacks and 

*** the time needed to find: (1) the root cause, (2) enforce incident response, and (3) remediate identified issues.

*** Coverage of security policies
