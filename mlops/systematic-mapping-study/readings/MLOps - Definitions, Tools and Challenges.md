RQ2: Approaches and Tools for MLOps:

## Metrics
* Maturity levels
* Google model consists of three levels and its structure is presented in Figure 3. 
  * MLOps level 0: Manual process, MLOps level 1: ML pipeline automation, MLOps level 2: CI/CD pipeline automation. 
* Microsoft model consists of five levels and its structure is presented in Figure 4. 
  * Level 1: No MLOps, Level 2: DevOps but no MLOps, Level 3: Automated Training, Level 4: Automated Model Deployment, Level 5: Full MLOps Automated Operations.

## Approaches:
* ToughWorks
  * A software engineering approach in which an interoperable team produces machine learning applications based on code, data and models in small, secure new versions that can be replicated and delivered reliably at any time, in short custom cycles
  
* AutoML
  * The process of creating and selecting the appropriate model, as well as the preparation of the data, turns into a much simpler and more accessible process
  * The AutoML tool works as a pipeline and so we have no control over the choices it will make
  * But The AutoML retraining is a much easier and straightforward task. 

Associated Tools:
* Tools Category
  * Data processing tools
  * Modeling tools
  * Operationalization Tools

RQ3: Challenges in Operationalizing MLOps:

## Challenges:
RQ4: Integrating Responsible AI Principles into MLOps Pipelines:
* Collobration between ML engineers, and production engineers to facilitate model deployment.
* Integration of ML models into production has long been a complex challenge.
* Balance between flexibility and compatibility because there are too many tools.
  * Make a list of the available tools that are capable of solving the individual problem in every task. Then, we can check the compatibility between them in order to find the best way to go
  * Requires excellent knowledge of as many tools as possible from every team working on a MLOps system
* Creation of robust pipelines with strong compatibility
* Evolving is another critical point of a high maturity level of a MLOps platform, thus constant retraining shifts in the top of the current challenges.
* There are many problems that complicate or even make retraining impossible
* Having to manually label the new data but slows down the process and fails at constant retraining tasks.

## Reviewer's Comments: [Any subjective notes, comments, or observations you might have after reading and summarizing the paper.]
Draws a lot on the capitability between tools and piplines (data maniupulation pipeline, mode creation pipeline and development pipeline)
