#+TITLE: Towards Regulatory-Compliant MLOps: Oravizioâ€™s Journey from a Machine Learning Experiment to a Deployed Certified Medical Product
#+DESCRIPTION:

* TODO MLOps Challenges in Multi-Organization Setup
** Challenges
Machine learning do not allow software engineering methodologies to be applied uniformly.
Need for a diversity of skills to take a machine learning model to production.
Data collection and preparation 
  The quality, structure and relevance of data is key to the performance of a machine learning model. Data can come from different sources, different levels of quality and in different formats
  
Ensuring Data consistency
  Is also a key element of machine learning and is challenging for systems which require large amounts of manually labelled data

Hidden Technical Debt
  Hidden technical debt refers to the machine learning support system (Table 1) needed to test, monitor, update and maintain a production machine learning system [20] [21] which integrate the different machine learning libraries and pipelines.
  
Troubleshooting machine learning systems can be difficult due to dependencies between different models

Component Entanglement
  Maintaining strict boundaries between models during development is difficult as the models can interact in unexpected ways

  
Therefore difficult to build using sequential development methods.
** TODO Benefit
Allows engineers to define experiments through the data features and to rapidly analyze results, thereby allowing multiple experiments can be managed in parallel by a small team
** TODO Tool
** TODO Approach humans
Data-Centric Machine Learning
  Data-centric machine learning is gaining attention, promoted by experts like Andrew Ng.
  This approach simplifies risk and complexity in machine learning projects.
  Model parameters are fixed early, allowing focus on data experimentation.
  Easier to align system performance with user expectations.
  Automation is key in stages like training, evaluation, and deployment for effective data-centric experimentation.
  
Agile SDLC for Machine Learning Application Development

Collaborative
Encourage greater team participation and collaboration through the simplification of the experimentation process.

Simplify experimentation and discovery within an agile development workflow

MLASDLC

MLASDLC advocates for the deployment application to be rapidly built early in the project
  And thereby allows the machine learning systems to be designed, experimented upon and tested using the real-world environment.
