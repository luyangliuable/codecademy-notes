#+TITLE: Towards Regulatory-Compliant MLOps: Oravizioâ€™s Journey from a Machine Learning Experiment to a Deployed Certified Medical Product
#+DESCRIPTION:

* TODO MLOps Challenges in Multi-Organization Setup
** Challenges
Data Privacy and Governance: Ensuring compliance with regulations across different organizations.
Model Versioning: Keeping track of multiple model versions being used across organizations.
Resource Allocation: Managing computational resources for training and deployment in a way that is efficient but fair across organizations.
Workflow Standardization: Maintaining a standard workflow for ML model development, training, and deployment across multiple organizational setups.
** TODO Benefit
Efficiency: Centralizing MLOps could lead to more efficient use of resources.
Collaboration: Easier to share best practices and tools across organizations.
Consistency: Consistent approaches to AI governance and ethical considerations.
** TODO Tool
Kubeflow: For orchestrating ML workflows.
Azure ML: Offers enterprise-level services for ML, including governance tools.
AWS SageMaker: Provides a fully-managed service that covers the entire machine learning workflow.
** TODO Approach
Standardized CI/CD Pipelines: Ensure that all organizations adopt a similar CI/CD pipeline structure for model development, testing, and deployment.
Governance Audits: Regular checks to ensure compliance with AI governance and ethical norms.
** TODO Metrics
Model Performance Metrics: Like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Compliance Metrics: Measuring adherence to regulations and organizational policies.
Resource Utilization Metrics: To monitor and manage computational costs.
** TODO Responsible AI mentions
Responsible AI mentions
Ethical Guidelines: Establish ethical guidelines for model development and deployment.
Transparency and Accountability: Include features for model explainability and auditing.
Social Impact Assessment: Assess the social impact of deploying the AI models, including considerations like fairness and equity.
** TODO How to implement Responsible AI
Ethical Framework: Develop a framework that embeds ethical considerations into the model lifecycle.
Expert Reviews: Involve ethicists or experts in the domain to review the models.
User Consent: Ensure that data used has been ethically sourced and that end-users have given informed consent.
Monitoring and Auditing: Regularly audit AI systems for compliance with ethical guidelines and make adjustments as necessary.
