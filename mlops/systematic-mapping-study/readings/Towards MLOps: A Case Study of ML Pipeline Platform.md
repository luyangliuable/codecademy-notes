RQ3: Challenges in Operationalizing MLOps:

## Challenges:
* Performance bottlenecks due such as GPU utilisation.
  * Model decay over time  such as due to changes in data distribution of the environment.
* A lot of computational resources required
* The monitoring and evaluation of a model may loop back to any previous step of development.
* Massive datasets for model training and testing also bring unignorable challenges to Data storage and management
* Takes time

RQ4: Integrating Responsible AI Principles into MLOps Pipelines:

## Strategies/Methods:
* Monitoring Systems
* Logging Systems
* Git version control
* SDK for developers from kubeflow for pipeline configuration.
