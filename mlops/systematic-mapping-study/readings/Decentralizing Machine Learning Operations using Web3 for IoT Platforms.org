#+TITLE: Towards Regulatory-Compliant MLOps: Oravizio’s Journey from a Machine Learning Experiment to a Deployed Certified Medical Product
#+DESCRIPTION:

* TODO MLOps Challenges in Multi-Organization Setup
** Challenges
Data Privacy and Security: Data transfer between different organizations could lead to potential security risks.
Scalability: The Whisper protocol must be able to handle deployments across multiple organizations.
Interoperability: Different organizations may use different cloud services and tools, making seamless integration a challenge.
Compliance: Organizations have to abide by various regulations, and aligning them in a multi-organization setup can be challenging.
Version Control: Managing different versions of models and data across organizations.
Data Drift: The challenge of managing data drift could become more complex when dealing with multiple organizations.

Trust issues between data controller and AI service provider.
Ensuring CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) in AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things).
Handling sensitive payload and metadata from IoT devices.
Complexity in B2B and B2C setups, including human oversight and third-party data processing.
Integrating with emerging technologies like blockchain and Web3.
** Benefit
Resource Utilization: Better use of resources as organizations can leverage each other’s strengths.
Knowledge Sharing: Different organizations can learn from each other's data and models.
Economies of Scale: Bulk operations may lead to cost benefits.

Real-time data processing and intelligence.
Centralized control in cloud infrastructure.
Enhanced security and privacy through blockchain and Web3.
Scalability and adaptability for both B2C and B2B applications.
** Tool
Multi-tenant Cloud Services: To handle deployments across different organizations.
Encryption Tools: For secure data transfer.
Integration Platforms: To ensure that different tools and services work together seamlessly.


Distributed cloud infrastructures for data processing.
Blockchain technology for ensuring trust and security.
Web3 software stack for building decentralized systems.
** Approach
Partition MLOps process into data collection, model training, and deployment.
Adopt Web3 architecture for secure IoT communication.
Use blockchain to establish trust between entities without mediators.
Employ Responsible AI practices in AIoT services.
** Metrics
Wasserstein Distance: For monitoring data drift.
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): For evaluating model performance.
Compliance Metrics: To measure adherence to regulations.
Accuracy and speed of AI models.
Level of CIA compliance.
Efficiency of data transmission and processing.
User satisfaction metrics.
** Responsible AI mentions
Privacy and confidentiality of data, including GDPR compliance.
Transparency in data processing and decision-making.
Ethical implications of AI decision-making.

** How to implement Responsible AI
Integrate data-centric approaches to focus on high-quality, unbiased data.
Employ interpretable machine learning models to provide explanations for AI decisions.
Regular penetration testing to ensure security measures are effective.
Build in transparency features to allow stakeholders to understand how data is used.
Follow ethical guidelines and legal regulations related to data privacy and security.

Security & Privacy


Data Mesh Networks & Anonymity

End-to-End Encryption & Zero Trust Architecture

MLOps & Machine Learning Processing

Transparency: Make the process transparent, ensuring that stakeholders understand how decisions are made by the AI.
Ethical Compliance: Implement standards that ensure AI decisions do not discriminate against any groups.
Human Oversight: Make sure humans are involved in the decision-making process to catch any errors or biases that the AI may perpetuate.
Data Privacy: Use techniques like anonymization to ensure that personal data is not misused.
