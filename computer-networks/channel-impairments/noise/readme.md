## Most Common Types of Noise
* Thermal Noise / Johnson-Nyquist Noise
  * Produced by thermal agitation of charge caerriers in a medium.
  * It can usually be reduced by cooling.
* Shot noise
  * Produced by quantum physical fluctuations in electrical current.
  * Prominent in semiconductors
  * Proportional to current magnitude.
* Burst/Popcorn/Impulse Noise
  * Multiple causes
  * Commonly quantum effects in semiconductor defect sites or interfering sources with random processes.
* Pink/Flicker/ 1/f / Fractal Noise
  * Multiple causes
  * Spectrum displays increasing power with decreasing frequency.
* Brownian/Red Noise
  * Similar to Pink Noise
  * Faster rolloff as frequency increases.
* Addtitive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
  * Most common mathemtical representation for thermal noise widely used to approximate shot noise.
