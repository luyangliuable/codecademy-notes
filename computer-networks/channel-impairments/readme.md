## Types
* Noise
  * Random fluctuations in signal power.
* Interference
  * Additive or multiplication inclusion of other signals degrading signal quality.
* Distortion
  * Malformed shape in original waveform produced by transmission medium.
* Dispersion
  * Distortion induced by different pathlengths or propagation velocities seen by signal components.
* Fading
  * Time variant loss of signal due to destructive interference effects seen in some radiofrequencies.
* Loss
  * Reduction in signal levels arriving at the receiver.
