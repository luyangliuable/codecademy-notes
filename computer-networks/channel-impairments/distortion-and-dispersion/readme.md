Any action that alters the temporal shape of a waveform as it propagates through a channel.

## Consequences
* If the distortion is severe enough, a receiver will be unable to distinguish symbols correctly.
* A single or multiple bit errors may be produced
* Causes inter symbol interference which may cause bit errors.
* Dispersion Will limit the achievable bandwidth through a channel.## Causes
* One common cause of distortion and dispersion is the loss of channel bandwidth

### Wired Connection
* Electrical degradation of cables due to an aging water ingress.
* This is due to variations in the cable's impedance or refractive index caused by aging or water ingress, which can cause different parts of the signal to travel at different speeds.
* As a result, the **signal can become distorted and lose clarity**, which can impact the quality of the communication or data transmission.

### Wireless Connection
* Dispersion and distortion can typically occur in wireless connection when multiple copies signal arrives to the receiver
  * This is commonly due to multipath propagation in radio-frequency channels.
  * Multipath propagation may be due to refraction through turbulent air.
