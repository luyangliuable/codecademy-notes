## Designing Overall Quality of Service
* Study intended purpose:
  * Traffic types to be carried
  * Required network QoS
  * Performance requirement
  * Required network performing for the use

* Use intended purpose and requirement to determine performance requirements for
  * Routers in network
  * Links between routers in network

* End-to-end connection considerations
  * A transmitter and receiver in a network involves a serial chain of routers and interconnecting links.
  * Where inadequacy in any single router or link compromises the QoS and performance of the whole (multi-hop) chain through the network
