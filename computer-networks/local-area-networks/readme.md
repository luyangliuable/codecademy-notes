# Local Area Networks

## Purposes
* Used inside individual **buildings**, groups of buildings, campuses with **high throughput** and **low latency interconnect**.

* Personal Computer LANS
  * Low cost
  * Limited data rate

* Backend networks and storage area networks
  * Interconnecting large systems (mainframes and large storage devices)
  * High data rate
  * High speed interface
  * Distributed access
  * Limited distance
  * Limited number of devices.

* High speed office networks
  * Desktop image processing
  * High capacity local storage

* Backbone LANS
  * Interconnect low speed local LANs
  * Reliability
  * Capacity
  * Cost


### Backbone LANS vs Backend netoworks and storage area LANS


| Backbone LANs                                                           | Backend Networks and Storage Area LANs                                               |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Focus on connecting multiple LANs together within a larger network.     | Focus on provoding high-speed data transfer and storage access within a data center. |
| Provide high speed communication between geographically dispersed LANs. | Allows servers to share **data** and **computing resources**.                        |
| Support a large number of users and devices.                            | Share computer resources inside san organisations data center or server room.        |
| Often based on fiber-optic and high speed ethernet cables.              | Often based on high performance ethernet or fibre channel cables.                    |
| Can support data rates up to several gigabits per second.               | Can support data rates of up to several terabits per second.                         |


## Performance
* Early LANs has data rates before 10 Megabits/s

## Cables
* Early LANs can be **twisted pair**, **coaxial**, **fibre** cables types.


## Design
* Often combine LAN specific physical layer and datalink layer to form an integrated product
* Adaptors embedded inside computers as an internal **adaptor card**.
