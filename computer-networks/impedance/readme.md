## Reflection and Return Loss [#impedance-mismatch]()

* Causes **Impedance mismatch**

* Variation in impedance in cables product signal reflections in the direction opposite to that of signal propagation.

P\_Out = P\_In - P\_R

* Increases Loss of the cable and causes intersymbol interference.


## Impedancy mismatch
* Commonly occurs between cables and termination devices, cables and connectors.
* Occurs between cables spliced with different cables.
  * Occurs between mechanical damage to cables such as bending twisting crushing or crimping.
* Severe impendence mismatch may even prevent cable use

RL[dB] = −20log10(| Γ |) = − 20log\_10[|(ZL − ZS)/( ZL + ZS )|]
Γ = (ZL − ZS)/( ZL + ZS )

* Γ - reflection coefficient
* Z\_L is load impedence
