Power budgets in link design typically determine the ratio of input signal power to the
receiver, relative to the power levels of unwanted impairments, such as receiver noise,
interference and crosstalk;
ยง If the power budget makes inadequate allowances for impairments, the SNR,
Signal/Interference and Signal/Crosstalk ratios, for any given modulation scheme, will
yield unacceptably high BERs;
ยง Importantly, in a multi-hop network, the end-to-end BER, without error control, will be
determined by the sum of BERs across all N hops in the network:
