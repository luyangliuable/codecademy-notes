# Discussion forumn

We are all users and also unique individual people. Our needs, pain points and motivations are key factors that influence the decisions that we make. Conversely, we can also look at information about an individual and theorise or speculate about attributes of users.

## Chosen App: VIM

The Name of the app is Vim for iOS. It is a text editor that can edit any files that exist on your phone. Normally, Vim is used on your computer to allow you to perform typing actions really quickily by incorporating mnemonics and different modes (normal mode, insert mode and visual mode). I started using Vim at a very early age and is very intuitive to use on the phone. I can jump to any location of the page and different files faster immediately.  I am a person who values convenience when I am outside.

I need to code anywhere I go because it is a hobby for me. Vim for iOS allows me to do that.

 The pain point is to be able to code on the go like on the bus. Most phones has a small screen and the touch screen is not tactile (lacks ergonomics) so it is always a bad choice to code with. It is rare for people to code on the phone but I decided to give vim a go on the phone and it works great. I think the reason why I stuck with it is the convenience it brings for me and i am very efficient with it. Vim also incorporates mnemonics so I find that once you learn it you can retain the ability to use it for a long time.

Of course, there are other choices such as "Koder Code Editor". Due to my previous familiarity with Vim and it holds a very special position in my heart because I figured out a trick to install extensions on vim for iOS so psychologically I am driven to come back to use the app. I think being a curious person and a tinkerer drove me to do such a niche thing. It is almost impossible to make a choice and switch to Koder Code Editor.


In normal mode, you cannot insert new text but you can use all the avalaible keys to perform navigation and text actions such as copy, delete or paste. This makes the editor incredibily efficient and also allows you to store macros. In insert mode, you can insert new text and finally visual mode you can select paragraphs. This is really useful because you can perform a huge range of actions using all the keys depending on which mode you are in.

I believe Vim is the limit to what humans are able to achieve but also has a flexibility where you can use it to a level that matches your abilities. It is like a using cockpit of a plane because regardless of how skilled you are at piloting you can reach your destination as long as your level of ability is high enough.


## Final Draft

## Clearly state the name of the app and briefly describe its purpose.
Vim on iOS is a text editor for any file on your phone. Normally, Vim is used on your computer to allow you to type quickly using mnemonics and different editing modes. I can jump anywhere on the page and to different files immediately.

## How does this app address a specific need for you or people like you?
I often find myself needing to code anywhere I go. Vim for iOS allows me to do that because I can access my phone anywhere. Vim is a great editor for coding due to my experience with it.

## How does this app address a specific pain point for you or people like you?
The pain point is that I have to bring my laptop everywhere to code, while also most phones have a small screen and are not ergonomic. Vim addresses both of these problems by providing shortcuts so you can jump around the file on the phone while zoomed in. I stuck with it due to the convenience it brings for me.


## What is a motivation that makes you prefer this app over other similar apps?
Other choices include "Koder Code Editor". There is also a psychological factor why I am loyal to Vim as I figured out a trick to install extensions even on iOS. I am unable to do the same on Koder. Therefore being a curious tinkerer and the journey of overcoming its steep learning curve are also factors.
