* Aims to improve user experience and the **aesthetics** of an interface.
* Key to generating **positive emotions**
* Use visual elements for reaching **effective communication**
* **Draw attention** to certain objects and improve visibility.
* Used to **optimise user experience** and aide memory.

* Visual element attributes:
    * Lines
        * Straight or curved
        * Thin or wide
        * Different stroke styles (e.g. dotted, solid)
    * Shapes
        * 2D region
        * Visible: Must differ in fill/stroke from surrounding
    * Color
        * **Meaning vary between cultures and are not universally accepted**
        * Hue: Shade of colour (rgb)
        * Saturation: Intensity of colour
        * Value: The lightness or darkness
        * Used to
            * Draw attention
            * Provide cues
            * Aide comprehension and memory
            * Appeal to mood
            * Improve navigation and scanning speed
    * Typography
        * Balance legibility and visual appeal of text.
    * Texture
        * How surface would **feel when touched**.
        * Associated with skeuomorphic design
        * Expensive
        * Complex background present challenges for visibility and readability
        * Prove less value for understanding an interface
        * Alternatives
            * Gradient
            * Translucent blurred background
    * Space
        * Create structure
        * Enhance readability
        * Discrete chunks of information
        * Feeling of openness

## Guidelines For Using Visual Design

### Guidelines For Using Visual Elements
* Legible typefaces and comfortable text spacing.
* Variable font sizes and user-selectable colour modes.
* Use a limited colour palette (3 colours).
* Don't use colour alone to convey information.
* Compatibility with operating system accessbility features.
* Do not create too much asymmetry

#### Colour
* Don't
    * Too many colors
        * can easily overwhelm users
    * Each colour has a purpose
    * Implement contrast
        * Light and dark for readability
        * Dominance to draw attention

#### Typography
* Don't
    * Use too many typefaces
    * Size of text too small
    * Inconsistent sizes
    * Insufficient space between lines
    * Text not aligned with left edge

### Texture
* Don't
    * Too complicated
    * Reaction of real materials, apparent variation in a surface can function as texture.

## Visual Design Principles
### Scale
Refers to using relative size to **signal importance** and rank a composition.
    * Larger items are **dominant** and more noticeable
    * **Use no more than 3 different sizes**.
        * Too many will increase **cognitive load**.
    * Creates visual hierarchy
Influence what user **notices first on a screen**.
    * Minise effort to discover important things.
### Visual Heirarchy
Guiding the eye on the page so that it attends to different design elements in order of their importance.

Can be:
    * Sequence of scale
    * Difference in **colour** and **brightness**
    * Difference in **alignment** and **spacing**.

* Bad visual heirarchy require more effort to parse.
* Can influence user behaviour


### Balance
Symmetric balance around an axis.
    * To generate directional flow
    * Create a sense of dynamic energy

### Contrast
