## When to Use Colors in Data Visualization:
  * Consider alternatives to gradient colors.
  * Limit the number of colors to seven.
  * Use bars, positions, or areas for important values.

## How to Make Better Color Choices:
  * Use the same color for the same variables.
  * Explain what colors encode.
  * Consider grey as an essential color.
  * Ensure high enough contrasts.
  * Consider color relations and the size of areas.
  * Choose intuitive colors.
  * Use light colors for low values, dark for high.
  * Avoid gradient color palette for categories.
  * Use lightness to build gradients.
  * Don't use more than 2 hues for gradients.
  * Consider diverging color gradients if you want to emphasize how a variable diverts from a baseline.
  * Consider color-blind people.
