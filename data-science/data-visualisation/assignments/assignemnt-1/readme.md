## Proposal
Domain
The domain of this data visualisation project will be Global Climate Change.

Why?
Climate change is a globally pertinent issue, impacting every corner of our planet and its inhabitants in diverse ways. Understanding the patterns and the changes over time is critical for informed decision making at personal, organisational, and governmental levels.

A visualisation on this topic will be useful for educators, policymakers, students, environmentalists, and the general public. The interactive design will aim to enhance understanding, foster awareness and possibly inspire climate-friendly actions.

Datasets
The main datasets that will be utilised for this project will come from various reliable sources that provide open access to their data:

NASA's Climate Change Data: NASA's Climate Change Data. This provides data on CO2 levels, global temperature, ice melt, sea level, etc.

Berkeley Earth: Berkeley Earth Data. It provides data on land and ocean temperature changes.

NOAA's Climate Data: NOAA's Climate Data. This provides data on various climatic parameters like atmospheric conditions, drought, cyclones, etc.

Design Ideas
The design of the visualisation will aim to be interactive and informative, drawing inspiration from visualisations such as "The Pudding's 'The True Size of Countries'" and "Information is Beautiful's 'Mountains Out of Molehills'". The project will aim to balance aesthetics with simplicity, ensuring the design is intuitive and engaging.

A world map will serve as the backbone of the visualisation, representing the global aspect of climate change. Users will be able to select different climate parameters (e.g., temperature change, CO2 levels) and the map will visually adjust to reflect these data points.

A time slider will also be incorporated allowing users to see changes over time. Apart from this, certain specific events or points of interest can be clicked for more detailed view or data. This level of interactivity will allow users to explore the data and understand the impacts of climate change at both macro and micro levels.
