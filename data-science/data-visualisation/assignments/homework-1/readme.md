## Part B - Colour, Layout and Typography

### A brief description of improved aspects of the visualisation.
* Implemented the Proximity Gestalt principle to ensure that the title of each sheet is placed directly above it for clear identification.

* Utilized a sequential color scale for the Florida Demographics data to enhance the intuitive reading experience. This decision was made due to the lowest population being spread across most regions, necessitating different colors to depict them accurately.

* Enhanced the legibility of the introductory text by making it darker and changing the font to Times New Roman, as serif fonts are known to improve readability.
* Optimized the introductory text by reducing the number of letters per line, which aids in easier visual tracking.

* Introduced a hierarchical structure to the chart by graying out the lines representing California and Texas, emphasizing the importance of Florida.
* Replaced the legend for the states with annotations, as only three lines are present and two have been grayed out. This change eliminates the need for overlapping, providing a clearer representation.
