### 1. **Proximity**
- Objects close together are seen as part of a group.
- Example: Dots close together are seen as distinct groups.

### 2. **Similarity**
- Objects of similar color, shape, or size are seen as related.
- Example: Blue circles or grey squares are grouped together.

### 3. **Enclosure**
- Objects enclosed together are seen as part of a group.
- Light shading can be enough for enclosure.
- Example: Shaded area separates forecast from actual data.

### 4. **Closure**
- People perceive individual elements as a single shape.
- Unnecessary elements like borders can be removed without losing cohesion.
- Example: Elements are perceived as a circle, even if incomplete.

### 5. **Continuity**
- Eyes seek the smoothest path and create continuity.
- Unnecessary elements like y-axis lines can be removed.
- Example: Bars are lined up at the same point even without a vertical line.

### 6. **Connection**
- Objects physically connected are seen as part of a group.
- Connection often has a stronger associative value than color, size, or shape.
- Example: Shapes connected by lines are paired together.

### Conclusion
- The Gestalt principles help to identify unnecessary elements in visual design.
- They ease the processing of visual communications.
- They are applicable to real-world examples.
