# OS Command Injection

## Countermeasures
* Carefully Sanitise all user input data
    * **Avoid passing user arguments to OS programs at all** if possible.
    * Use OS command execution API that takes OS command and argument as separate parameters: not to be interpreted as command.
    * Use exec() function instead of system.

* Strip out separators and damaging characters like pipes (|) and ampersand (&) to prevent running additional commands.
    * The best way is to use a whitelist.
    * For the filename examples given earlier, maintain a list of acceptable file names. Discard everything else.
