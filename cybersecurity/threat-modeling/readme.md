A process by which potential threats such as structural vulnerability or absence of safeguards can be identified and enumerated.

* It is realistic
* Considers attacker's capabilities

## Stride Approach [#spoofing]() [#tampering]() [#repudiation]() [#information-disclosure]() [#denial-of-service]() [#elevation-of-Previlage]()

* spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information-disclosure, denial-of-service, elevation-of-Previlage

* Break software security into separation components and analyze each component for threats to mitigate each of them.
