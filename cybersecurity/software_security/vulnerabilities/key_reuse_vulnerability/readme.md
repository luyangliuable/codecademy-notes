A type of attack that is used to symmetric-key encryption systems that use the same key or multiple encryptions.

## A key reuse attack can be performed in a number of ways:
* A known-plaintext attack, where an attacker has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext.
    * P1 = C1 xor PRGB(K)
    * P2 = C2 xor PRGB(K)
    * P1 xor P2 = C1 xor C2 xor ~~PRGB(K) xor PRGB(K)~~
    * Therefore P2 = P1 xor C1 xor C2

* A chosen-plaintext attack, where an attacker can choose the plaintext and encrypt it with the same key to obtain the corresponding ciphertext.

* A man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can intercept and modify the ciphertext and the plaintext.
