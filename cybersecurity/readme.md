Welcome to our cybersecurity notes repository! In this repository, you will find information and sample code on various cybersecurity topics that will help you to understand the basics of protecting your digital world.

We live in a digital age where almost everything we do is connected to the internet. From online banking, shopping, and social media to the control systems of critical infrastructure, our lives are becoming increasingly dependent on technology. As a result, cybersecurity has never been more important.

## Buffer Overflow (BOF)
A buffer overflow is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This can cause the program to crash or, in the worst-case scenario, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. Understanding and being able to identify buffer overflow vulnerabilities is an important aspect of cybersecurity.

## Format String Vulnerability
A format string vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program uses unvalidated user input as a format string in a call to a function such as printf(). This can cause the program to crash or, in the worst-case scenario, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system. Being familiar with format string vulnerabilities and how to prevent them is crucial for any cybersecurity professional.

## SQL Injection
SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious SQL code into a database query. This can be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database, or to execute arbitrary code on the system. Understanding and being able to identify and prevent SQL injection attacks is an essential aspect of cybersecurity.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web page viewed by other users. This can be used to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, or to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. Understanding and being able to identify and prevent XSS attacks is an important aspect of cybersecurity.

## Trust in Software
Trust in software is the confidence that a system or component can be relied on to behave honorably, reliably and securely under the right circumstances. Trust is an important aspect of cybersecurity, especially when it comes to the implementation of security measures such as encryption and authentication.

## Hardware Assisted Trust
Hardware assisted trust refers to the use of specialized hardware security features, such as secure enclaves and secure boot, to provide an additional layer of security. These features can help to protect against a wide range of threats, including attacks that target the firmware, BIOS, and operating system. Understanding and being able to implement hardware assisted trust measures is an important aspect of cybersecurity.

Please note that the sample codes provided are for educational and demonstration purposes only, and should not be used in production systems without proper testing and modification.

This repository is meant to be a starting point for cybersecurity learning, it is important to always keep updating your knowledge and stay informed about the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
