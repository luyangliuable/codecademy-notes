# States

## HTTP is Stateless
* Lifetime of HTTP:
  1. Client **connects to the server**
  2. Client **issues a request**
  3. Server **responds**
  4. Client **issues a request for something in the response**
  5. Repeat...
  5. Client **disconnects**
* **HTTP won't remember** the same user again
