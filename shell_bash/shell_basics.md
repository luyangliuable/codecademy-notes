## Finding Help

### **Which text-based command provides information on the use of other Linux commands and utilities? List at least two. 
(**)

```shell
man
```

```shell
manual

### To assignment password for new user

```shell
sudo passwd username
```

### To create a user and set login group to user

```shell
sudo useradd -g users username
```


#### Multiple groups
```shell
sudo useradd -g users -G wheel,developers username
```

### To see groups a user is part of
```shell
groups username
```

### To create a user with a unique ID

```shell
sudo useradd -u 1500 username
id -u username
```

>> 1500

### Creating a User with an Expiry Date
```shell
sudo useradd -e 2019-01-22 username
sudo chage -l username # Vertify expiry date
```

read your home directory’s contents.

### Owner read only file
```shell
chmod u-w filename.txt
```

### Owner read only home directory
```shell
chmod u-w ~/
```

### Owner write permission enable
```shell
chmod u+w test1.txt
```

### Enable owner execute and for group to write and execute
```shell
chmod u+x,g+wx test1.txt
```

## What does chmod 4775 filename mean?
* The owner can read, write and execute. 

* Group can read, write and execute. 

* Others can read, can't write and can execute.

## How do you set the executable permission on a file? List the command-line. 

### Enable Execute Permission on a file
```shell
chmod +x test1.txt
```

## List the command-line for inspecting the permissions assigned to a file or directory. 

TODO These commands should work for both files and directories.

```shell
ls -l filename 
```

or

```shell
stat filename 
```

### Octal notation
Read or r is represented by 4,
Write or w is represented by 2
Execute x is represented by 1.

d (directory)
c (character device)
l (symlink)
p (named pipe)
s (socket)
b (block device)
D (door)
- (regular file)


e.g. -rw-r--r--@
* The first - char means it is a regular file.
* rw- represents permission for the owner (read and write).
* r-- represents permission for the group (read only).
* r-- represents permission for the others (read only).

### Linux Shell 

## What is your default Linux shell? Read the manual pages on your shell and then
answer the following questions. 

/bin/bash

## How do you get the last command-line re-displayed? 
* Up arrow

## Which key-stroke invokes filename completion? 
* Tab key


## Which file in your home directory contains the PATH variable, what does it do, and how do you inspect its value?

```
. ~/.bashrc
```

### To add a new path value

Inside ~/.bashrc

```
export PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/tools:$PATH
. ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.bashrc for some linux os
```

### Inspect PATH values

```
echo $PATH
```

## What does the shell function alias do? Add an alias to your shell configuration file and test that it works. List the command-lines.

Aliss acts as a nickname or shortcut to commands. Can be added by adding

```
alias stopmongodb="brew services stop mongodb/brew/mongodb-community"
```

To ```~/.bashrc``` or running it in the terminal.

## How does which command work? List a command-line demonstrating its function. 
Which command find the source program file of the command in the user's file path.

```shell
which node
```

>> /opt/homebrew/bin/node

## How do you execute a program file in the shell? List the command-line. 

```shell
./program_to_execute
```

e.g. node

```shell
/opt/homebrew/bin/node
```

## Why it’s sometime necessary to prefix ./ to run an executable file?
By Default when you type anything in unix terminal it checks the list of
directories specified by PATH variable. If ./ is included POSIX will just run
the filename directly.


## How are the contents of a text file displayed? List the command-line

### Without line number
```shell

chmod u+x test.sh
./test.sh
```


## Networking
